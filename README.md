# NASSCOM-Packaging
Repository for the lab exercises of the "VSD NASSCOM Semiconductor Packaging Workshop" (03/28/2025-04/06/2025 Cohort).

## Module 1 - Packaging Evolution: From Basics to 3D Integration
There are no exercises prescribed for this module.

## Module 2 - From Wafer to Package: Assembly and Manufacturing Essentials
There are no exercises prescribed for this module.

## Module 3 - Labs: Thermal Simulation of Semiconductor Packages with ANSYS

The objective of the lab is to model a FlipChip BGA package and perform a thermal simulation in the Ansys Electronics Desktop (AED) environment. The phases involved are the following:

1) Start the Ansys Electronics Desktop Student software
2) Create package
3) Set boundary conditions
4) Set temperature monitors
5) Define the mesh
6) Perform the thermal simulation
7) Explore results

#### 1 Start the Ansys Electronics Desktop software

When starting the Ansys Electronics Desktop software, the main window will display quick access buttons for its different tools (HFSS, Q3D, Circuit, Icepak, Maxwell, Simplorer). The one that will be used in the rest of this lab is Icepak.

By clicking the Icepak button, a new Icepak design is created into the project and we navigate into the Icepak environment:
